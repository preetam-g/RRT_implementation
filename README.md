# RRT_implementation
Implementing an autonomous robotic path planning algorithm namely Rapidly exploring random tree(RRT). Used in simple obstacle modeling of the space and helps in path planning of wheeled robots.

# Obstacles, start and end points
Obstacles are treated as circles centered at a given location on the screen. 
I have not added any method to add obstacles manually, for testing purposes I have set fixed start, end points and obstacles in between them. I have commented out the code where we can input start and end location. I have also written code for random obstacle generation which can be replaced with manually addition later on if required.

# Here are images of implementation
